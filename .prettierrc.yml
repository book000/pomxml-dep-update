And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9 Name:: Shining_120@yahoo.com or zakwarlord7@HOTMAIL.com/repository@ZachryTylerWood.Administrator@.git]::request::PUSH:e.g@iixixi/iixixi.Read.md/Paradise PUSH@IIXIXI/IIXIXI/READ.MD https://github.com/bitore/bitcoin/branches/trunk/@iixixii.json.yaml.docx/versioning@v-0.1.6,3.9.11xprocess.md#syncing-with-TEIRAFOURM: actually called TIERAFORM dnspython latest Search docs CONTENTS: What’s New in built with Bundled with dnspython using their builder not that they are the builder you've got it all wrong Community Installation Dnspython Manual DNS Names DNS Rdata DNS Messages The dns.message.Message Class Making DNS Messages Message Flags Message Opcodes Message Rcodes Message EDNS Options The dns.message.QueryMessage Class The dns.message.ChainingResult Class The dns.update.UpdateMessage Class DNS Query Support Stub Resolver DNS Zones DNSSEC Asynchronous I/O Support Exceptions Miscellaneous Utilities A Note on Typing DNS RFC Reference Dnspython License dnspython Docs » Dnspython Manual » DNS Messages » The dns.message.Message Class The dns.message.Message Class This is the base class for all messages, and the class used for any DNS opcodes that do not have a more specific class. classdns.message.Message(id=none of your business it was private repository)[] A DNS message. id An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id. flags An int, the DNS flags of the message. sections A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects. edns An int, the EDNS level to use.

This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173. keyring A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None. keyname The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None. keyalgorithm A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module. request_mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC of the request message associated with this message; used when validating TSIG signatures. fudge An int, the TSIG time fudge. The default is 300 seconds. original_id An int, the TSIG original id; defaults to the message’s id. tsig_error An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0. other_data A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes. mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC for this message. xfr A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False. origin A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None. tsig_ctx An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None. had_tsig A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format. multi A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. first A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. index A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None. additional The additional data section. answer The answer section. authority The authority section. find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset.

The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object. get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. If the RRset is not found, None is returned. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None. is_response(other)[source] Is other a response this message? Returns a bool. opcode()[source] Return the opcode. Returns an int. question The question section. rcode()[source] Return the rcode. Returns an int. section_from_number(number)[source] Return the section list associated with the specified section number. number is a section number int or the text form of a section name. Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known. Returns a list. section_number(section)[source] Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing. section is one of the section attributes of this message. ::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"' Returns,?,"true?,", set_opcode(opcode)[source] Set the opcode. opcode, an int, is the opcode to set. set_rcode(rcode)[source] Set the rcode. rcode, an int, is the rcode to set. to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source] Convert the message to text. The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. Returns a str. to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source] Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format. Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used. max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”. multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence. tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers. Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded. Returns a bytes. use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source] Configure EDNS behavior. edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”. ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values. payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be. request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload. options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options. use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source] When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added. key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used. keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use. The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key. keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored. fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge. original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used. tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code. other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data. algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes. want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source] Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests. wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled. The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods: dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0> Message sections dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1> Message sections dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2> Message sections dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3> Message sections Beat Triplebyte's online coding quiz.

And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9 Name:: Shining_120@yahoo.com or zakwarlord7@HOTMAIL.com/repository@ZachryTylerWood.Administrator@.git]::request::PUSH:e.g@iixixi/iixixi.Read.md/Paradise PUSH@IIXIXI/IIXIXI/READ.MD https://github.com/bitore/bitcoin/branches/trunk/@iixixii.json.yaml.docx/versioning@v-0.1.6,3.9.11xprocess.md#syncing-with-TEIRAFOURM: actually called TIERAFORM dnspython latest Search docs CONTENTS: What’s New in built with Bundled with dnspython using their builder not that they are the builder you've got it all wrong Community Installation Dnspython Manual DNS Names DNS Rdata DNS Messages The dns.message.Message Class Making DNS Messages Message Flags Message Opcodes Message Rcodes Message EDNS Options The dns.message.QueryMessage Class The dns.message.ChainingResult Class The dns.update.UpdateMessage Class DNS Query Support Stub Resolver DNS Zones DNSSEC Asynchronous I/O Support Exceptions Miscellaneous Utilities A Note on Typing DNS RFC Reference Dnspython License dnspython Docs » Dnspython Manual » DNS Messages » The dns.message.Message Class The dns.message.Message Class This is the base class for all messages, and the class used for any DNS opcodes that do not have a more specific class. classdns.message.Message(id=none of your business it was private repository)[] A DNS message. id An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id. flags An int, the DNS flags of the message. sections A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects. edns An int, the EDNS level to use. The default is -1, no EDNS. ednsflags An int, the EDNS flags. payload An int, the EDNS payload size. The default is 0. options The EDNS options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects. The default is the empty list.

This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173. keyring A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None. keyname The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None. keyalgorithm A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module. request_mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC of the request message associated with this message; used when validating TSIG signatures. fudge An int, the TSIG time fudge. The default is 300 seconds. original_id An int, the TSIG original id; defaults to the message’s id. tsig_error An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0. other_data A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes. mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC for this message. xfr A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False. origin A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None. tsig_ctx An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None. had_tsig A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format. multi A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. first A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. index A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None. additional The additional data section. answer The answer section. authority The authority section. find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object. get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. If the RRset is not found, None is returned. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None. is_response(other)[source] Is other a response this message? Returns a bool. opcode()[source] Return the opcode. Returns an int. question The question section. rcode()[source] Return the rcode. Returns an int. section_from_number(number)[source] Return the section list associated with the specified section number. number is a section number int or the text form of a section name. Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known. Returns a list. section_number(section)[source] Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing. section is one of the section attributes of this message. ::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"' Returns,?,"true?,", set_opcode(opcode)[source] Set the opcode. opcode, an int, is the opcode to set. set_rcode(rcode)[source] Set the rcode. rcode, an int, is the rcode to set. to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source] Convert the message to text. The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. Returns a str. to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source] Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format. Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used. max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”. multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence. tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers. Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded. Returns a bytes. use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source] Configure EDNS behavior. edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”. ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values. payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be. request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload. options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options. use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source] When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added. key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used. keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use. The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key. keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored. fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge. original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used. tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code. other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data. algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes. want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source] Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests. wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled. The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods: dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0> Message sections dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1> Message sections dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2> Message sections dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3> Message sections Beat Triplebyte's online coding quiz.

++signature when it was decoded from wire format. multi A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. 
++
++This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. first A bool, which is True if this message is

++stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are 
++
++part of a zone transfer. index A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default 
++
++is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None. additional The additional data section.

++section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is 
++
++False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False. 
++
++Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object. get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)
++
++[source] Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. If the RRset is not found, None is returned. section, an int section number, or 
++
++
++one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: 
++
++my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the 
++
++name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. 
++
++The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is 
++
++not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a 
++
++matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Returns a 
++
++dns.rrset.RRset object or None. is_response(other)[source] Is other a response this message? Returns a bool. opcode()[source] Return the opcode. Returns 
++
++an int. question The question section. rcode()[source] Return the rcode. Returns an int. section_from_number(number)[source] Return the section list 
++
++associated with the specified section number. number is a section number int or the text form of a section name. Raises ValueError if the section isn’t 
++
++known. Returns a list. section_number(section)[source] Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing. section is one of the 
++
++
++
++
++
++section attributes of this message. ::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"' 
++
++Returns,?,"true?,", set_opcode(opcode)[source] Set the opcode. opcode, an int, is the opcode to set. set_rcode(rcode)[source] Set the rcode. rcode, an 
++
++int, is the rcode to set. to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source] Convert the message to text. The origin, relativize, and any other keyword 
++
++arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. Returns a str. to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source] Return a 
++
++string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format. Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. origin, a 
++
++dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be 
++
++
++used. max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”. 
++
++multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence. tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the 
++
++ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers. Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded. Returns a bytes. use_edns(edns=0, 
++
++ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source] Configure EDNS behavior. edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, 
++
++False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”. 
++
++
++
++ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values. payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can 
++
++handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be. request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not 
++
++specified, defaults to the value of payload. options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options. use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, 
++
++fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source] When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added. 
++
++key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used. keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is 
++
++either the TSIG keyring or key to use. The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a 
++
++
++
++bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary 
++
++is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable 
++
++keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key. keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or 
++
++None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is 
++
++ignored. fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge. original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used. tsig_error, an int, the TSIG 
++
++error code. other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data. algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and 
++
++the key entry is a bytes. want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source] Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests. wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data 
++
++is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled. The following 
++constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods: dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0> Message sections 
++
++dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1> Message sections dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2> Message sections

And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9 Name:: Shining_120@yahoo.com or zakwarlord7@HOTMAIL.com/repository@ZachryTylerWood.Administrator@.git]::request::PUSH:e.g@iixixi/iixixi.Read.md/Paradise PUSH@IIXIXI/IIXIXI/READ.MD https://github.com/bitore/bitcoin/branches/trunk/@iixixii.json.yaml.docx/versioning@v-0.1.6,3.9.11xprocess.md#syncing-with-TEIRAFOURM: actually called TIERAFORM dnspython latest Search docs CONTENTS: What’s New in built with Bundled with dnspython using their builder not that they are the builder you've got it all wrong Community Installation Dnspython Manual DNS Names DNS Rdata DNS Messages The dns.message.Message Class Making DNS Messages Message Flags Message Opcodes Message Rcodes Message EDNS Options The dns.message.QueryMessage Class The dns.message.ChainingResult Class The dns.update.UpdateMessage Class DNS Query Support Stub Resolver DNS Zones DNSSEC Asynchronous I/O Support Exceptions Miscellaneous Utilities A Note on Typing DNS RFC Reference Dnspython License dnspython Docs » Dnspython Manual » DNS Messages » The dns.message.Message Class The dns.message.Message Class This is the base class for all messages, and the class used for any DNS opcodes that do not have a more specific class. classdns.message.Message(id=none of your business it was private repository)[] A DNS message. id An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id. flags An int, the DNS flags of the message. sections A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects. edns An int, the EDNS level to use. The default is -1, no EDNS. ednsflags An int, the EDNS flags. payload An int, the EDNS payload size. The default is 0. options The EDNS options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects. The default is the empty list.

This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173. keyring A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None. keyname The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None. keyalgorithm A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module. request_mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC of the request message associated with this message; used when validating TSIG signatures. fudge An int, the TSIG time fudge. The default is 300 seconds. original_id An int, the TSIG original id; defaults to the message’s id. tsig_error An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0. other_data A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes. mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC for this message. xfr A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False. origin A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None. tsig_ctx An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None. had_tsig A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format. multi A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. first A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. index A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None. additional The additional data section. answer The answer section. authority The authority section. find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object. get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. If the RRset is not found, None is returned. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None. is_response(other)[source] Is other a response this message? Returns a bool. opcode()[source] Return the opcode. Returns an int. question The question section. rcode()[source] Return the rcode. Returns an int. section_from_number(number)[source] Return the section list associated with the specified section number. number is a section number int or the text form of a section name. Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known. Returns a list. section_number(section)[source] Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing. section is one of the section attributes of this message. ::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"' Returns,?,"true?,", set_opcode(opcode)[source] Set the opcode. opcode, an int, is the opcode to set. set_rcode(rcode)[source] Set the rcode. rcode, an int, is the rcode to set. to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source] Convert the message to text. The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. Returns a str. to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source] Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format. Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used. max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”. multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence. tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers. Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded. Returns a bytes. use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source] Configure EDNS behavior. edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”. ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values. payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be. request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload. options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options. use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source] When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added. key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used. keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use. The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key. keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored. fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge. original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used. tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code. other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data. algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes. want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source] Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests. wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled. The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods: dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0> Message sections dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1> Message sections dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2> Message sections dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3> Message sections Beat Triplebyte's online coding quiz.
